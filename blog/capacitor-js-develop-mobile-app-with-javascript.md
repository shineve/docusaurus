## What is Capacitor?

Capacitor is a cross-platform native runtime for web apps which can build cross-platform Native Progressive Web Apps for iOS, Android, and the Web. ⚡️

## When to use Capacitor?

1. You're looking for a quick way to build your on-going project as Hybrid App.
2. You wanted to build Hybrid App but you're not using React.
3. Your company has no resources to hire Native App Developer.
4. Native App isn't your priority.

## Why Capacitor?

### **No framework limited**

You can just pick your preferred framework such as React, Vue or others since Capacitor can be dropped in any of your existing web app project, convert your project to Hybrid App with no Framework limited.

### **Universal App**

You can build web-based applications that run equally well across iOS, Android and web with single codebase.

### **Native APIs**

Capacitor provides native plugin APIs to help you easily access and build cross-platform core native features such as Camera, Geolocation, Notifications and so on.

### **Made By Ionic**

Capacitor is made by [Ionic Team](https://github.com/ionic-team) which focus on building tools and services for building cross-platform mobile apps.

## Wrap Up

Capacitor is a good choice if web is your prior or you're having limited resources, it has no front-end framework limited so it is compatible with everything.

I had good experience with Capacitor and I hope you can ride on this trends too!
