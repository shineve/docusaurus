### **Background**

I trust many front-end engineers feel that reproducing animations with CSS is really hard.

Let me introduce you a really nice library which can save you from that, [Lottie](https://airbnb.design/lottie/) (produced by [Airbnb](https://www.airbnb.com)).

Lottie is not restricted to [Web development](https://github.com/airbnb/lottie-web) but also [Android](https://github.com/airbnb/lottie-android), [iOS](https://github.com/airbnb/lottie-ios), [React Native](https://github.com/lottie-react-native/lottie-react-native) and [Windows](https://github.com/windows-toolkit/Lottie-Windows), which means you can use the same file source in all platforms.

### **Demo**

Here is a [online Lottie web player](https://lottiefiles.com/web-player) and [Android sample app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.airbnb.lottie) which you can play and preview the power of Lottie.

### How To Use Lottie

Designers install [Adobe After Effects Plugin](https://github.com/airbnb/lottie-web#plugin-installation) to export their animation as JSON, then developers can play the file with Lottie. Really easy isn't it!?

### **Pros**

1. **Small fie sizes and better color reproduction**

   Lottie animation in JSON is extremely small size compared to WebP, APNG and GIF while maintaining good color reproduction.

2. **Cross-Platform**

   As I mentioned earlier, library for [Web](https://github.com/airbnb/lottie-web), [Android](https://github.com/airbnb/lottie-android), [iOS](https://github.com/airbnb/lottie-ios), [React Native](https://github.com/lottie-react-native/lottie-react-native) and [Windows](https://github.com/windows-toolkit/Lottie-Windows) are supported, keeping the same file source in all platforms could reduce complexity.

3. **High Manipulability**

   Lottie allows developers to manipulate the animation in anyway they like and also most importantly, you can program your animation to respond to any interaction, i.e. animation direction, playing speed, hover event...

4. **Nice browser support**

   [Check Browser Support](https://caniuse.com/?search=svg)

   Lottie animates through just pure SVG and JavaScript, so there is really high support among browsers if your in web development.

5. **Made by Airbnb**

   Lottie is created by Airbnb, Airbnb has always been active in the open source community, Airbnb have contributed lots of [open source projects](https://airbnb.io/projects/), the most known is the [JavaScript style guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript).

## **Wrap Up**

You should try to use Lottie if your project has high demand in animations. It is simple to add cool animations to your projects with just a few lines of codes.
